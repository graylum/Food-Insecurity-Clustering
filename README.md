Food Insecurity in North Carolina: Analyzing Demographic Impacts with Clustering

Analyzing contributers to an overall Food Insecurity Rate, comparing characteristics across NC counties through clustering, analyzing cluster outliers for key observations.

Abstract:

In the United States, increases in factors such as cost of living, price of housing, unemployment, and low-wage jobs have contributed to a large portion of the population experiencing Food Insecurity. When individuals face the challenge of obtaining adequate food due to economic constraints or geographical limitations, they are at risk of poor nutritional health. This condition is officially termed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as “Food Insecurity” (hereby referred to as FI) and is defined as “the limited or uncertain access to adequate food .” FI affects people from various demographics, highlighting widespread challenges. While broad data concerning FI on a national scale exists, studies focused locally in North Carolina remain sparse. This study employs socio-economic, demographic, and spatial data acquired from the Food Access Research Atlas, Map the Meal Gap, and Census data to construct a clustering model that identifies patterns associated with FI in North Carolina. We utilize a k-means clustering model paired with PCA in order to reduce dimensionality while creating a total of four cluster profiles. Following the clustering model, a k-nearest neighbors regression model is used to validate the results further. Each profile represents the differing needs of counties for every county. Key findings indicate that rural and suburban counties have the highest FI rates and the greatest distances to a supermarket. Cluster 2 has among the worst socio-economic measures, such as the highest poverty rate and lowest education attainment rates. Cluster 1 has the furthest distances to supermarkets and the second-highest food insecurity rates.
